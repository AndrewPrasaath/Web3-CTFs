# 1. Fallback
### Challenge
- Claim ownership of the contract
- Reduce its balance to 0
### Contract
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Fallback {

  mapping(address => uint) public contributions;
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    contributions[msg.sender] = 1000 * (1 ether);
  }

  modifier onlyOwner {
        require(
            msg.sender == owner,
            "caller is not the owner"
        );
        _;
    }

  function contribute() public payable {
    require(msg.value < 0.001 ether);
    contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    if(contributions[msg.sender] > contributions[owner]) {
      owner = msg.sender;
    }
  }

  function getContribution() public view returns (uint) {
    return contributions[msg.sender];
  }

  function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  receive() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}
```
### Solution
##### Explanation
**Receive function:** It executes on calls to the contract with no calldata, e.g. calls made via send() or transfer(). This is a function triggered when a contract receives ether without any calldata.\
\
How can we exploit this? There are two ways to claim ownership here: contribute to the contract more than the current owner (or) exploit the faulty check-in receive function. If we have any value of contribution and send any amount of ether to the contract, we will claim the ownership.
##### Exploit
All we need is a test ETH of 2 wei for the contract and the required test ETH for gas. I used `Remix IDE` (other options Etherscan, Hardhat, etc).
1. Invoke `contribute()` function with 1 wei. This will satisfy `contributions[msg.sender] > 0` condition
2. Send `1 wei` to the contract address. Ownership is transferred.
3. Since ownership is changed we can access `withdraw()` with `onlyOwner` modifier. Call `withdraw()` to drain the contract balance.\
\
Congratulations! We successfully became the owner of the `Fallback contract` and stole the balance in it.

# 2. Fallout
### Challenge
- Claim ownership of the contract
### Contract

import 'openzeppelin-contracts-06/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Fallout {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping (address => uint) allocations;

  /* constructor */

    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner {
	        require(
	            msg.sender == owner,
	            "caller is not the owner"
	        );
	        _;
	    }

  function allocate() public payable {
    allocations[msg.sender] = allocations[msg.sender].add(msg.value);
  }

  function sendAllocation(address payable allocator) public {
    require(allocations[allocator] > 0);
    allocator.transfer(allocations[allocator]);
  }

  function collectAllocations() public onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  function allocatorBalance(address allocator) public view returns (uint) {
    return allocations[allocator];
  }
}
```
### Solution
##### Explanation
**Solidity v0.5.0 Breaking Changes:** Constructor needs to be defined using the `constructor` keyword instead defining a function with the same name as the contract. [solidity doc link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/050-breaking-changes.html#constructors)\
Solidity compiler throws an error if there is a function with the name of the contract. That's the reason here they misspelled the `Fal1out` for `Fallout`. Since this uses a version above 0.5.0, the `constructor` keyword must be used for the constructor. This makes the function `Fal1out` just a normal function that can be called by anyone.
##### Exploit
1. Call `Fal1out()` and the ownership is changed.\
\
Hurray! We got another ownership.
